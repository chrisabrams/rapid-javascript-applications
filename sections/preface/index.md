# Preface
I was inspired to write this book after spending half a year as a Director of Engineering at Cond√© Nast. There I worked with developers at Vanity Fair, Vogue, Wired, GQ, Architectural Digest, and Golf Digest, among other brands.

What I quickly recognized was that amongst the talented group of developers, few had built or redesigned a large website from scratch. I worked with a few of the teams on structuring their Javascript applications; after a few months my boss, Jason, joked that I should write a book about quickly building Javascript applications.

This book is the result of a compilation of great experiences while working with these teams.
